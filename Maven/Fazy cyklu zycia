Default Lifecycle

https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html

validate 	              validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available.
initialize 	            initialize build state, e.g. set properties or create directories.
generate-sources 	      generate any source code for inclusion in compilation.
process-sources 	      process the source code, for example to filter any values.
generate-resources 	    generate resources for inclusion in the package.
process-resources 	    copy and process the resources into the destination directory, ready for packaging.
compile 	              compile the source code of the project.
process-classes 	      post-process the generated files from compilation, for example to do bytecode enhancement on Java classes.
generate-test-sources   generate any test source code for inclusion in compilation.
process-test-sources 	  process the test source code, for example to filter any values.
generate-test-resources create resources for testing.
process-test-resources 	copy and process the resources into the test destination directory.
test-compile 	          compile the test source code into the test destination directory
process-test-classes 	  post-process the generated files from test compilation, for example to do bytecode enhancement on Java classes.
test 	                  run tests using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed.
prepare-package 	      perform any operations necessary to prepare a package before the actual packaging. This often results in an unpacked, processed version of the package.
package 	              take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
pre-integration-test 	  perform actions required before integration tests are executed. This may involve things such as setting up the required environment.
integration-test 	      process and deploy the package if necessary into an environment where integration tests can be run.
post-integration-test 	perform actions required after integration tests have been executed. This may including cleaning up the environment.
verify 	                run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria.
install 	              install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally.
deploy 	                done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
